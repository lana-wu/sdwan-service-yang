# Guidance on how to contribute

The primary way to contribute feedback on this draft is to send an email to opsawg@ietf.org <opsawg@ietf.org>.
However, if you prefer to use this GitHub repo, there are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the latest version of the draft.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest changes, report bugs, and ask questions.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a change request, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_ guidance below.


## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull-request. All changes to the draft should work with [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/) and be free of any errors when checked using [IDnits](https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/index). Additionally, the changes should mimic the styles and patterns in the existing draft.
